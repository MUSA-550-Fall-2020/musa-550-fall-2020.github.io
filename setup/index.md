This course will depend heavily on two open-source tools: `conda` and `Jupyter`.

The `conda` tool will enable us to easily install Python on your local computer
as well as the numerous libraries we will use throughout the course. The
`Jupyter` software provides an easy-to-use, self-contained environment for
running Python and is the primary way we will write and execute Python
throughout the course. The lecture materials and assignments throughout the
course will all be _Jupyter notebooks_.

This guide will walk through instructions for installing and using both
`conda` and `Jupyter`.
